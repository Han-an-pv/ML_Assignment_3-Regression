# ML_Assignment_3-Regression
Used the California Housing dataset available in the sklearn library. This dataset contains information about various features of houses in California and their respective median prices. 
Loaded and preprocessed the data  then,performed necessary feature scaling ..
Implemented the following regression algorithms: Linear Regression ,Decision Tree Regressor ,Random Forest Regressor ,Gradient Boosting Regressor and Support Vector Regressor (SVR).
Evaluate the performance of each algorithm using the following metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) R-squared Score (RÂ²) Compare the results of all models to find the best and worst
